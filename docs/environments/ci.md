**üõ† Differences Between Local Execution and Build in a Vue Application with TypeScript**

When developing a Vue application with TypeScript, it may run smoothly in local development but fail during the build process (`vite build` or `vue-tsc --noEmit`).

This happens because **type checking behaves differently** in development and production modes:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **In Development Mode (`vite dev`)**  
- Vite uses **esbuild** for TypeScript transpilation, which **does not perform strict type checking**.  
- Only syntax or import errors are detected, meaning some type-related issues may go unnoticed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **During Build (`vite build`)**  
- The build process relies on **Vue TSC** (`vue-tsc --noEmit`), which performs **full TypeScript type checking**.  
- Errors that were not visible during development may appear, such as:  
  - Incorrect types in props, emits, or computed properties.  
  - Inconsistencies in interfaces or generic types.  
  - Accessing properties that are missing from the expected type.
